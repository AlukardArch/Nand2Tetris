# Nand2Tetris - Building a computer from scratch

My first delve into software. This repository contains my own, somewhat working solutions to Nand2Tetris projects.

## Progress so far

### Part 1 - Building the hack computer

* #### Project 1: Completed
	- Building elementary logic gates, Multiplexers and Demultiplexers.

* #### Project 2 : Completed
	* Implementing HalfAdder, FullAdder and ALU.

* #### Project 3 : Completed
	* Building RAM, Registers, and Program Counter.

* #### Project 4 : Completed
	* Developing basic programs in HACK assembly.

* #### Project 5 : Completed
	* Implementing CPU and completing memory chip with IO support. Combining all of it into HACK Computer.

* #### Project 6 : Completed
	* Developing a 2-pass assembler in Python.

* #### To be continued...
